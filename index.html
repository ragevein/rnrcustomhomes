            <span class="atten">A huge shout out </span>
            and gushing recommendation for our contractor Ben Richeson of R&R Custom Homes for helping us turn our water leak disaster into a beautiful new kitchen, pantry, and mud room, living room.  We love it! 
            Ben was a pleasure to work with and all of his subs were amazing.  I highly recommend him, and if we ever get a chance to build I'd be thrilled to work with him again.  If any of you need a contractor let me know and I'd be happy to share his contact info. 
            Thanks Mikelle Richeson for sharing the photos; Derek did a fantastic job!<div class="date"> - May 1, 2021

            Ben at RNR Construction was <span class="atten">very easy to work with </span> from start to finish. He was easy to get ahold of and kept us up to date on the progress of the house. He was flexible with our changes and had good advice and ideas. Mikelle really helped us to make design choices. They make a wonderful team and were very enjoyable to work with. If we ever build another house we would definitely use them again!

             <span class="atten"> We loved working with RNR homes</span> for our home renovation! Ben did an amazing job planning and managing our project. He is patient, has great communication and went out of his way to make things just the way we wanted them. His subs are some of the best we have ever dealt with! They all created a beautiful product and we couldn’t be happier with our home! We appreciated their attention to detail and how accommodating they were with all of our special requests! We will definitely be recommending Ben and his team to anyone looking to remodel or build a new home!
